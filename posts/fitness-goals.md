### Fitness Goals

In 1 year, Mar 11 2025, I want to be able to:

	- Touch my toes while standing up
	- Sit cross legged
	- Proper standing posture with shoulders back, neck straight
	- Bench 225 (at least 1 rep)
	- Deadlift 315 (at least 1 rep)
	- Squat 315 (at least 1 rep)
	- At least 10 45-lb weighted pull ups in neutral grip
	- At least 10 90-lb weighted push ups
	- At least 6min 1-mile time

Steps to accomplish this are weekly hot yoga, sprinting once per week, three days of lifting with emphasis on lower body, dynamic stretching incorporated into workouts, mindfulness of posture while walking and working, walking in nature and breathing exercises.
