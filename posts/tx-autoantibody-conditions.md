#### A new treatment for antibody-mediated autoimmune conditions: Columns to filter specific autoantibodies from peripheral blood 

Autoimmune conditions can be mediated by a number of immune cells including, but not limited to, B cells making antibodies against normal structures in our bodies. Here, let us think about some strategies to treat conditions caused by autoantibody production. 

As a representative example, let us consider pemphigous vulgaris (PV), a rare (0.5-3.2 per 100k) but serious blistering disease caused by the production of autoantibodies (autoAb) against two proteins: desmoglein 1 and 3 (Dsg1 and Dsg3). 

These autoAbs are produced by short-lived plasmablasts (terminally differentiated B cells), circulate through the bloodstream, bind Dsg1/3 and disrupt the cellular junctions holding the squamous epithelium of skin together causing acantholysis, the keratinocytes to fall apart. The specific autoAbs created are predominantely IgG4 (does not fix complement) over IgG1 (fixes complement) meaning that the mechanism of action is through physically impeding the cell junctions and signaling not inflammation and tissue destruction.   

There are a few treatment options for PV: a) corticosteroids and immunosupressants, b) IVIG, c) Plasmapharesis, d) B cell depletion. 

Steroids and immunosupressants were introduced in the 1950's and 1960's and turned a previously fatal condition into a condition with a mortality rate of 8.2% per year. Immunosupressants essentially turn off the patient's immune system making them extremely susceptible to infections and without any protection these can often be deadly. They can also cause hepatotoxicity and pancytopenia. Steroids produce a lot of off-target effects including hypertension, edema, osteoporosis, glaucoma, GI upset, hyperglycemia, and a laundry list of other possible consequences. Obviously, this strategy is not ideal. We want a treatment modality that has less side effects and lower mortality rate.  

IVIG is immunoglobulin pooled from donors and contains IgG, IgA, IgM, cytokines, and cytokine antagonists. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRN) on vascular endothelial and antigen-presenting cells binds the constant region of IgG molecules and protect it from degradation. IgG molecules not bound to FcRN taken up by these cells are degraded. In PV patients, non-pathogenic antibodies from IVIG compete with the pathogenic antibodies for FcRN binding. This increases pathogenic antibody degradation. 


What do I have to contribute to this space or conversation? What is the purpose of me writing this?

Can sketch out exactly why immunoadsoprtion would be, at best, the second best strategy behind rituximab if implemented. Figured out by german people in 1980s. 


Plasmapheresis exists where we drain the blood of all antibodies and then replenish the person with IVIG (pooled Ig from donors). This is very temporary as the abberant B cells will continue producing the anti-Dsg1/3 Abs soon. Straight IVIG infusions can be helpful, and can lead to a decrease in pathogenic Abs by FcRN receptor degradation on endothelial cells. (This action is not specific and simply a product of the relative abundance of pathogenic to nonpathogenic Abs sampled by FcRN influenced by the total prevalance of these Abs). 

CD20 marker marks PreB to MBCs and Rituximab can deplete these populations. It has no effect on short and long lived plasma cells - we think (?) the short lived ones are what is pathogenic but since they are short lived they will die. B cell precursors regenerate the B cell pool once Ritux is withdrawn. Long lived plasma cells and protective Ab titers are spared. 

CarT Cells,  Filter pathogenic ab with columns against desmoglein 1/3 in plasmapheresis more specific better response. people in germany are working on this. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoadsorption, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6130267/)
