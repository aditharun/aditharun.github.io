The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of a test are important measures of their accuracy but are dependent on the prevalence of the tested condition in the test population. 

Ideally, both PPV and NPV would be 1. These are perfect tests. 

The $PPV = \frac{N_{TP}}{N_{TP} + N_{FP}}$. How can we express PPV as a function of prevalence to observe their relationship to one another? 




Sensitivity or true positive rate is $\frac{{N_{TP}}{N_{TP} + N_{FN}}} and 
Specificity is $\frac{{N_{TN}}{N_{TN} + N_{FP}}}. And, prevalence is $\frac{N_{TP} + N_{FP}}{N_{FN} + N_{TN}}.
