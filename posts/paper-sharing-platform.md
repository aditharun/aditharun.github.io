### A social platform for sharing scientific papers with friends and colleagues

The basic premise of this tool would be to allow people to share the papers they read online. A living diary of the scientific content they read.

When choosing what to read, it would be nice to see what colleagues and friends have read.

Each account has a homepage where their posts are located. A post consists of two things: a) the paper's title, journal, link, and b) an optional caption spot for the account to write their thoughts, however brief on the paper. Each post has a comments section where discussion may happen, and a like button. Users can search and follow accounts, and their feed is composed of the accounts they follow. An optional feature includes feeds that contain posts similar to the user-followed content. 

But, how do people actually post their content? It is too clunky to ask people to copy paste urls, no one wants to do that. Ideally, we would provide one or both of these options: 1) a mimic of ReadCube's feature of automatically popping up when you enter a scientific paper's webpage or click their extension's button, 2) being an option when you click the 'share to' button on a paper's webpage. 

So, to create a post, you would download the Chrome extension. Upon landing on a paper's webpage, clicking the extensions' button shares it to your account. A similar feature is offered by ReadCube - it deposits the article in a database viewable by your organization. To view your feed and account, there would be a webpage and app structured like a text-based instagram. 

This might be useful in passively broadening the papers people read beyond their specific research area.
