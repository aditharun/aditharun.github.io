#### Take more at-bats

The periods of Beethoven's career that had the most hits also had the most misses. If Beethoven could not increase his batting average over time, what makes you think you can? 

The quality of your output in whatever it is that you care about does not vary with age. So, attempting to improve your hit rate is a waste of time as you progress through a creative career. Instead, focus on more at-bats. Focus on more output. (h/t [Marc Andreessen](https://pmarchive.com/age_and_the_entrepreneur.html))

Taking more bats is good but, fundamentally, it is easy to want to be, but hard to do. That's because the overwhlemingly most likely outcome of doing is rejection, imperfection, and judgment from others. That's scary and it sucks. First, know that people will talk and think about you for five minutes. Nobody thinks about you as much as you think about yourself. Don't worry, everyone is thinking about themselves. Second, and most importantly, love the process, love the routine. Not the outcome. Create a process and routine you love. Very briefly look at the outcome to reflect on how to get better, then wipe it away and go back to the next iteration of the process. **The score takes care of itself.**

> I think people make the best things when they love the process, when they willingly shoulder the inherent uncertainty and pain that comes with it. Itâ€™s almost like a form of prayer: you offer up what you can even though the reward is uncertain. You do it out of love. ([@noampomsky blog](https://ava.substack.com/p/effort

> Smart people seem to be especially at risk of such externally-driven behavior. Being aware of it helps, but only a little - you will likely have to work super-hard to not fall in the mimetic trap. The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world.

So, go and do things you like without paying much attention to the consensus opinion. Soliciting too much advice is a common problem, it washes out any useful information and makes you act not like yourself. Only consider the opinions of those who a) you respect, b) understand you, and c) understand where you want to go.

In all, [just start](https://twitter.com/bpoppenheimer/status/1647000062617088000). Start doing. Do whatever it is you are passionate about. Go get it, its not going to come to you. Granted, it may come to a tiny fraction of people, but that is not you. [Go earn it](https://blakeir.com/60e3b62d0f274edf8a9cf39b0cc2f26d). 

Fortunately for us, [excellence is mundane](https://academics.hamilton.edu/documents/themundanityofexcellence.pdf). It is doing the little things, learned or stumbled upon, consistently and correctly. These small things compound over time, like a snowball building mass:
