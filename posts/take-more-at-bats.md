#### Take more at-bats

The periods of Beethoven's career that had the most hits also had the most misses. If Beethoven could not increase his batting average over time, what makes you think you can? 

The quality of your output in whatever it is that you care about does not vary with age. So, attempting to improve your hit rate is a waste of time as you progress through a creative career. Instead, focus on more at-bats. More output. (h/t [Marc Andreessen](https://pmarchive.com/age_and_the_entrepreneur.html))

It is easy to want to be, but hard to do. That's because the overwhlemingly most likely outcome of doing is rejection, imperfection, and judgment[^1]. Embrace failure. Strive to be the [man in the arena](https://www.worldfuturefund.org/Documents/maninarena.htm). **Most importantly, love the process[^2]**. The outcome is not the point, ever. **The score takes care of itself.**

> People make the best things when they love the process, when they willingly shoulder the inherent uncertainty and pain that comes with it. Itâ€™s almost like a form of prayer: you offer up what you can even though the reward is uncertain. You do it out of love. ([@noampomsky](https://ava.substack.com/p/effort))

Do things because you feel compelled to [make something happen]((https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)) and because you love it. And do not pay much attention to the consensus opinion. Soliciting too much advice is a common problem - it often washes out any useful information and makes you act unlike yourself. Only consider the opinions of those who you respect, understand you and where you want to go. 

In all, [just start](https://twitter.com/bpoppenheimer/status/1647000062617088000). You have to go [earn it]((https://blakeir.com/60e3b62d0f274edf8a9cf39b0cc2f26d)), it is not going to come to you[^3]. Fortunately, [excellence is mundane](https://academics.hamilton.edu/documents/themundanityofexcellence.pdf). It is doing the little things, learned or stumbled upon, consistently and correctly. These small things compound over time [like a snowball building mass as its rolled down a really long hill](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2054761).

<small>[^2]: Create a process and routine you love. Very briefly look at the outcome to reflect on how to get better, then wipe it away and go back to the next iteration of the process. </small>
