#### POTS is a post-acute sequalae of a viral infection

Certain acute infections have long been associated with unexplained chronic conditions in a subset of patients [Choutka 2022, Nat Med](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01810-6). To name a few, there is post-dengue fatigue syndrome, Q-fever fatigue syndrome after Coxiella burnetti infection, post-ebola syndrome, and post-influenza syndrome. With COVID, people started to pay more attention to the tails of acute infections. These tails are characterized by symptoms that persist or develop well after initial infection. Usually, the pathogen is undetectable despite symptoms being reported. 


Long COVID is defined as ongoing, relapsing, or new symptoms or conditions present 30 or more days after COVID19 infection [Thaweethai 2023, JAMA Network](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2805540). Patients experience brain fog, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue and a range of other symptoms documented in this [Nature review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2). Rather interestingly, there are a few new-onset conditions that patients experience: dysautonomia (particularly POTS) and ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome). ME/CFS is commonly comorbid with POTS. But, for this post, we will focus our scope and dig deeper into POTS.

Dysautonomia refers to any condition that disrupts the autonomic nervous system - the system responsible for much of your involuntary physiological processes like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. Within this umbrella lies POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome). 

autonomic damage... but how? Nothing wrong with the RAAS system but the regulation of that system

in my experiences talkig with patients, it really affects their QoL and ... 

Patients report 

could pots be a largely post-viral condition?


covid19 literature on this suggests it is probably true. And it shares likely with other pathogens. It is remarkable that PASC, especially when it occurs after mild or moderate (rather than severe) COVID-19, shares many similarities with chronic illnesses triggered by other pathogenic organisms, many of which have not been sufficiently explained. exertion intolerance, disproportionate levels of fatigue, neurocognitive and sensory impairment, flu-like symptoms, unrefreshing sleep, myalgia/arthralgia, and a plethora of nonspecific symptoms that are often present but variably pronounced

Triggered by autoimmunity - autoantibodies against autonomic nerve fibers, adrenergic, acetylcholine, and angiotensin II receptors. OR virus attaches to ACE2 receptor, enters cell, and causes damage and dysregulation of RAAS system. OR neuroinvasive capabilities of virus. 

POTS paper unpublished: of long covid patients, nearly 1/3rd reported POTS. These affected patients were more likely to be female and more likely to be younger. People with POTS had similar health profiles to those without POTS before being infected with the virus. 


How does one just get POTS when they turn of a certain age? Why is it female predominate?
	Aren't autoimmune illnesses female predominate? makes sense pots could be too
	Genetic hits already preset you for this dysregulation and then the virus knocks it out of the park. It's like frayed wire and a scissor.
