#### Meta

Meta is down 15% pre-market on Apr 25, 2024 after reporting first quarter earnings and their outlook for the future. Meta reported [4.71 earnings per share](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q1/META-Q1-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf), well above the consensus estimate of 4.3. Revenue was in line with expectations too. But, for Q2, they expect revenue between 36.5B to 39B but analysts were expecting 38.5B which means the "midpoint of the range is a disappointment to the Street". This literally means nothing to me, if I am going to be honest - it feels pedantic. In general, investors are ["unhappy about profligate spending on AI"](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-25/meta-results-are-best-viewed-through-rose-colored-ai-glasses). Fundamentally, as an investor, you must ask yourself if you trust Mark and his vision for Meta. I do. But, we have data to support our decision too. 

 - Meta is not alone in this bet on AI. Literally every big tech company in software or the semiconductor supply chain from Adobe to Taiwan Semiconductors is heavily invested here. And I think the public (i.e., non-technical people) believe that "AI" refers exclusively to large language models and generative AI. This is not true. It is one technology that scientists and engineers in this space work on, and right now, there is a lot of effort to push the envelope here. But, no doubt, there are loads of other new technology being developed by AI engineers and scientists. 

 - Meta consistently puts out some of the best research and AI products. And, [they have always been heavily invested in ](https://research.facebook.com/publications/). Their LLM llama3 is quite good, and he says we are doing it as an "open source for the dev community and it is now going to be powering Meta AI. There's a lot that I'm sure we'll get into around Llama-3, but I think the bottom line on this is that we think now that Meta AI is the most intelligent, freely-available AI assistant that people can use."

 - They are open source. I love that. PyTorch is a great example. It is the go-to ML library, over Google's Tensorflow. Meta is committed not only to great products, but prioritizing the developer experience which is critical. I remember reading a story, I now can't find the link, of Mark testifying to Senate a few years back when Meta was under lots of congressional scrutiny and the CTO of facebook was calling PyTorch superusers to get their feedback. 

 - Mark is commitment to pursuing a future he believes in, and being focused. [Keep the main thing, the main thing](https://x.com/GuptaRK22/status/1781178952834531381). He says "the scarcest thing in a company of this scale is focus not cash". And he wants to focus on AI things - I agree. 

 - Always back a founder who builds and is technical. And [Mark built an AI assistant to help him around the house in 2016](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/12/20/mark-zuckerberg-builds-an-artificial-intelligence-assistant-to-run-his-house-and-entertain-his-toddler/). 

 - All AI requires compute. And computing resources cost lots of money and require spending. That spending would likely show up as "AI/Metaverse" spending on a balance sheet. Mark will acquire [35,000 H100 GPUs which will cost more than 10B dollars](https://www.techpowerup.com/318035/meta-will-acquire-350-000-h100-gpus-worth-more-than-10-billion-us-dollars?cp=2). He will probably buy more. With the purchasing of raw compute comes building the infrastructure, cooling, and energy considerations to figure out when scaling up your own computing farm - all of which cost money. And, [they are designing their own chips](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-deploy-in-house-custom-chips-this-year-power-ai-drive-memo-2024-02-01/) and deploying it in their data centers later this year. Wonderful. It costs more up front, but it will be better than relying on third parties (like Nvidia) in the long term. 

 - He's been here before ... literally 2 years ago. We have seen [this story before](https://www.investopedia.com/facebook-shares-hammered-on-outlook-driving-markets-lower-5218013). Facebook dropped 26% after dissapointing Q1 earnings in Feb 2022 as guidance from them raised concerns about growth prospects, and monthly active users fell for the first time ever. The stock fell another 60% from there till Nov 2022 for the above reasons, and concern about their heavy investment into the metaverse. 

- Their social media products are not going anywhere. Their product has gotten better over the past few years. They used to be really bad at serving Reels that were relevant / targeted compared to TikTok and now, they are on par if not better. How did they do that? ML models. And what are they investing their money in? ML models. How can they better personalize social media? How can they unlock the creativity of their young users to post, engage, and communicate with each other? AI-powered tools. I played around with their image generation - which is literally available in the search bar in instagram - and it is good at creating novel images. Their investment in AI will power their growth in the social media market as well as other markets, some of which I suspect we do not even know about. 


Spending money on AI, and spending money on AI with the focus and ideas he has (open source, scaling the computing farm, custom chips, research, talent), is the best use of resources.
