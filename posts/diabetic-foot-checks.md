Doppler US measures better what ABI estimates basically which is PAD and limb claudication. ABI is just blood pressure at the level of the ankle. 

So, how does noninvasive blood pressure monitoring work?
	Samsung watches can measure BP through pulse wave analysis, the same metric by which they measure HR

	but it appears that the watch will use an optical sensor to read blood pressure using a technique called photoplethysmography (PPG)

	The Galaxy S9 phone has an optical sensor that shines light onto tissue (in this case, the fingertips) and then detects how much light bounces back. That amount of reflected light is related to changes in blood volume in the tissue and that information is sent to Samsung’s My BP Lab app, where a proprietary algorithm interprets the results to estimate blood pressure

	On its own, PPG can technically only measure changes in blood pressure. That’s why it’s crucial that users calibrate the watch’s estimate with an actual blood pressure reading at the doctor’s office or one of those kiosks at Walgreens. “Calibration is really important,” says Mendes. “It’s like a scale. If I couldn’t calibrate a scale, I might only be able to predict when it goes up and down.”

	Though Apple rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co. have launched watches with the capability, they require monthly calibration with a traditional monitor.

	Its planned approach won’t tell users their specific systolic and diastolic readings -- the numbers used to assess blood pressure -- but would warn those wearing the watch that they may have hypertension, which is high-blood pressure, and should consult a doctor or use a standard blood pressure checker

	The integration of PPT, heart rate and one recent conventional BP measurement in the equation could increase the reliability of the BP evaluation [33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41371-022-00675-z#ref-CR33)

	Recently there were developed BP measurement devices using multiple PPG sensors without requiring incorporation of PTT. A wrist-size device (smartWatch, CareUp®) with two PPG sensors, has been proved to be quite accurate compared to conventional oscillometric devices, but without reaching AAMI certification prerequisites [34]. This method has two main limitations. Firstly, the stability of the PPG signal is affected by movements, narrowing its use to only non-ambulatory setting. A second limitation is the need for frequent calibration of the device. The device is primary calibrated by the doctor at the office; in this model it is considered that the heart rate does not change over time, taken into account a mean heart rate for the calibration of the device. However, hypertensive individuals seem to have high heart rate variability, therefore periodic calibration of the device is demanded



in pcp exam, they are supposed to do diabeteic foot check. can check with handheld doppler on DP or PT pulses. very simple, very definitive diagnostically. But, usually skipped becuase so much to do on a given visit. Can be clinically silent especially below the knee claudication in diabeteics and obese people. With medical management treatment outcomes are much better. Lots of people with diabetes are not sent to the proper referrals and specialists for their continuned management and getting these diagnoses earlier. Can we equip diabetics with at-home testing infra for diabetic foot checks where they slap something on and it records this and tracks with app and alerts doc? DP/PT patch waterproof? How can we diagnose this? PAD lecture from Wed Feb 15. Integration with OnDuo or some other glucose management device. Ankle brachial index?

What exactly are we measuring with handheld doppler PT? 
	pulse? flow through vessel? can this be approximated in apple watch or whoop or oura tech uses to look at vessels


ankle brachial index: wearable around foot sleek band design and wearable around arm sleek band design

what is ABI? basically blood pressure measurement at arm and ankle ratio'd together - can we wrap a band around the ankle like apple watch?

doppler US for looking at flow through blood vessels. hand held doppler exists. can we look at flow through vessel as wearable? hand held is 800-1000 bucks minimum. 

https://www.htworld.co.uk/news/engineers-develop-ultrasound-patch-to-monitor-blood-flow/ - patch for blood flow, requires power source and benchtop machines, not wireless.

US is a wonderful thing. And I suppose I just do not understand much of what is going on here in this space. It likely does not require much intuition and that might be the deciding factor. 

I would like to take on a task here that is indicative of the fact that we can both take on different things and vibe in respective categories. It makes almost no difference what the vibe is
