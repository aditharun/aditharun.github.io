#### A personal definition of artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is any mapping between inputs and outputs where one or more parameters are estimated. It is a decision rule that is not based on a pre-determined heuristic. 

AI is software written for a specific task where the process to generate the decision rules are known at the outset but the decision rules themselves are not. The decision rules are discovered by the process. 

Under this definition, linear regression is artificial intelligence.
