#### ctDNA marker for recurrence risk in CRC, Natera


e postsurgical risk stratifcation and adjuvant
chemotherapy (ACT) treatment decision-making.

Natera ($NTRA) works on cell-free DNA based molecular diagnostics focusing on women's health and oncology applications. They published a [2023 paper in Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02115-4.pdf) describing a cfDNA assay for identifying patients at increased risk for colorectal cancer recurrence post-surgery and therefore most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. 

Despite standard-of-care treatment, more than 30% of patients with resectable colorectal cancer (CRC) relapse. For any patient undergoing CRC surgery, the goal is to identify the patients for whom adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) will be beneficial. Specifically, we wish to stratify patients such that only those who will benefit from ACT receive it and those that will not benefit are not given ACT and spared from the side-effects and cost of chemotherapy.  

What is the current approach?




Surgical resection is the standard-of-care for patients with stage II or
III colorectal cancer (CRC), with subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy
(ACT) performed based on clinicopathological risk factors1,2
. For clinical stage IV or relapsed CRC cases with oligometastasis, perioperative
chemotherapy with metastasectomy is considered. However, over
30% of patients with stage II or III CRC and 60–70% of patients after
oligometastatic resection experience recurrence3,4
. The American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) panel states that the current
definition of ‘high-risk’ stage II cancer is inadequate as many patients
with high-risk features do not experience recurrence, whereas some
patients with average-risk features do. In addition, the ASCO panel
acknowledges that none of the listed high-risk features are predictive
of benefit from ACT5,6
. However, the current National Comprehensive
Cancer Network guidelines have remained in place since 2004 owing
to a lack of better prognostic factors to guide treatment decisions.
Although ACT has been shown to improve survival in patients with
stage III colon adenocarcinoma and is recommended for all patients
with stage III colon adenocarcinoma who are eligible to receive chemotherapy, researchers have reported large variability in outcomes and
questioned the absolute benefit of ACT in this population. In an analysis of 12,834 patients with stage III colon cancer enrolled in the IDEA
trial, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate varied greatly among

subgroups, ranging from 89% for the lowest-risk stage III (T1N1a) group
to 31% for the highest-risk cohort (T4N2b). The absolute DFS gain of
ACT for the lowest-risk stage III group and the highest-risk group was
8% and 20%, respectively7
. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a
substantial portion of patients with low-risk stage III cancer can safely
forgo ACT or be considered for treatment de-escalation (3 months
versus 6 months). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be a powerful tool to help guide treatment decisions in this cohort, especially
for patients with borderline performance status for whom treatment
toxicity is a main concern.




MRD, which is defined as ctDNA positivity after curative surgery or therapy, has been strongly associated with poor prognosis in patients with
surgically resectable CRC10–12. In this large prospective, observational
study with 1,039 patients with clinical stage II to IV or recurrent CRC who
underwent radical surgery (median follow-up of 16.74 months), we confirmed that patients with ctDNA positivity 4 weeks after surgery have a
significantly higher risk of recurrence than those with ctDNA negativity
4 weeks after surgery (Fig. 2a)

. Circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) analysis may enable postsurgical risk stratifcation and adjuvant
chemotherapy (ACT) treatment decision-making.






Methods for Personalized ctDNA assay for MRD detection
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue samples from surgical resection or biopsy were used for WES to identify up to 16 patient-specific clonal, somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), as previously described10. These SNVs were used to design personalized multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based next-generation sequencing assays (Signatera, Natera) for each study participant. Cell-free DNA was extracted from patient plasma (median 9.9 ml, range 1.6–12.2 ml), at a given time point and was used to detect ctDNA. Plasma samples with at least 2 out of 16 tumor-specific variants detected above a predefined threshold were defined as ctDNA positive. The predefined threshold is based on Natera’s proprietary variant calling method wherein detecting at least 2 out of 16 variants ensures the optimal analytical performance of the assay with > 95% sensitivity at 0.01% mean variant allele frequency and with 99.7% specificity21. ctDNA concentration was reported in mean tumor molecules per ml of plasma. ctDNA results for eligible patients before surgery and 4 weeks and 12 weeks after surgery are provided in Supplementary Table 7.


Resected tumor, used tumor tissue to inform genes selected for WES of plasma isolated ctDNA. Most genes selected were unique to that patient. 
	limitations: tumor is 3d tissue (chaos paper from Eric Topol), sampled site may not be indicative, tumors can mutate and present differently in recurrence old tissue may not be good indicator

	pros: informed by tumor, likely to capture some of the specifics of the tumor


Among 187 patients who were ctDNA positive
4 weeks after surgery, 61.4% (115 out of 187) experienced recurrence,
whereas only 9.5% (81 out of 852) of patients who were ctDNA negative 4 weeks after surgery experienced recurrence (hazard ratio (HR)
10.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.7–14.0, P < 0.0001), demonstrating an 18-month DFS of 38.4% (95% CI 31.4–45.5%) versus 90.5% (95%
CI 88.3–92.3%), respectively (Fig. 2a). Goes across stages. 

By contrast, no significant difference in recurrence risk by presurgical ctDNA status was observed (HR 0.89, 95% CI
0.55–1.4, P = 0.62) across all stages



CEA is not great but decent. carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA) data were available 12 weeks after surgery for a set of patients.
We compared postsurgical (12-week) CEA status with postsurgical
(12-week) ctDNA status and observed a concordance of ctDNA positivity
and negativity in 81.3% (654 out of 804) of patients and a discordance
in 18.7% (150 out of 804) of patients. Among the discordant cases, 70%
(58 out of 83) of the ctDNA-positive (CEA-negative) patients relapsed,
compared with 12% (8 out of 67) of the CEA-positive (ctDNA-negative)
patients (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that ctDNA was more informative
than CEA for relapse detection

Cost and feasability of implementing this?
	Tissue sample is processed in what way and by who to end up with these genes?
	What is the turn around time and how does that affect ACT starting timeline?
	Who does the ctDNA testing?

Inform whether person should go on ACT or not. 
	Some people who were not on ACT are now recommended to go on ACT. 
	Some people on ACT prior will be told not to go on ACT. 

	How does this shake out money wise?
