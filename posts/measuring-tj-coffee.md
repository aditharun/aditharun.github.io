#### Dosing Trader Joe's cold brew coffee concentrate

The [32 fluid ounce cold brew concentrate at Trader Joe's](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/cold-brew-coffee-concentrate-050759) contains the equivalent of about 96 ounces of coffee beverages when reconstituted with water or milk according to their website. The bottle says that it makes 12 8-ounce cups of coffee. 

The label does not tell you the caffeine content. We can assume that the Trader Joe's product follow's FDA guidelines when making their label. Per [FDA guidance for industry](https://www.fda.gov/files/food/published/Guidance-for-Industry--Highly-Concentrated-Caffeine-in-Dietary-Supplements-DOWNLOAD.pdf), "caffeine content varies in different products" but  "a typical eight-ounce cup of ground coffee contains approximately 95 milligrams of caffeine". 

If there is enough caffeine to make 12 8-ounce cups, then there is 1200 mg of caffeine in the cold brew container. That means, per fluid ounce of concentrate, we have $1200/32$ or 37.5 mg per fluid ounce. **A standard cup's worth of caffeine is 2.5 fluid ounces of concentrate.**

What about caffeine per ounce? Ounces are a weight unit and fluid ounces are a volume measurement. We must multiply the fluid ounce value by the density (ounce per fluid ounce) to get the ounce value. The composition of cold brew is typically a 1:4 coffee to water ratio. The density of coffee grounds is about [0.32 g/cubic centimeter](https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/5039/approximately-how-many-cups-by-volume-are-in-a-pound-of-ground-coffee-beans) which is ~0.33 ounce/fl ounce. In a 1:4 ratio, the density of cold brew is $\frac{1 \cdot 0.33 + 4 \cdot 1}{(4 + 1)} = 0.87$ ounces per fluid ounce. So, there is $37.5 \cdot 0.87 = 32$ mg of caffeine per ounce. **A standard cup's worth of caffeine is 3 ounces of concentrate**.
