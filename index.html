<p>I am currently an M2 at the Yale School of Medicine. I work with <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/harlan-krumholz/">Harlan Krumholz</a> to understand and investigate health disparities using outcomes data. I am interested in digital health, precision medicine, early detection and monitoring of disease, and building technology-driven solutions to deliver better healthcare experiences.</p>  

<p> I worked at <a href="https://www.delfidiagnostics.com">Delfi Diagnostics</a> to develop new approaches for detecting cancer early and monitoring response to treatment using cell-free DNA fragmentation patterns. Previously, I received a BS in applied math and statistics at Johns Hopkins focusing on statistical learning. At JHU, I worked with <a href="https://www.aacr.org/governance/victor-e-velculescu/">Victor Velculescu</a> and <a href="https://rscharpf.github.io/">Rob Scharpf</a> on methods for detecting cancer early using liquid biopsies and understanding the biological origins of cell-free DNA. I also spent time at IBM Research with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/us/ibm_fellows/2019/ibm-fellow-gustavo-stolovitzky.html">Gustavo Stolovitzky</a> developing ensemble learning algorithms based on the Fermi-Dirac distribution and a model for identifying syngergistic drug combinations.</p>  

<!--I am available for select consulting projects. I draw on my experiences and expertise in statistics, machine learning, computational biology, and diagnostics and therapeutics. Services I provide include due diligence evaluating the market and technology of a potential investment, designing (or reviewing designs) of statistics and ML methods for problems in medicine or biology, background education of statistics and science to technical and non-technical teams (see posts), and writing code (primarily in R; some Python and STAN/JAGS too) to analyze data and make intuitive and clean visualizations. Please shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:adith.3.arun@gmail..com">adith.3.arun@gmail.com</a> to get in touch.-->
