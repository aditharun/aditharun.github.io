<p>I am currently an MD Candidate at the Yale School of Medicine. I work at <a href="https://www.delfidiagnostics.com">Delfi Diagnostics</a> to develop new approaches for detecting cancer early using cell-free DNA fragmentation patterns. I am interested in digital health, precision medicine, and methods for early detection and monitoring of disease.</p>  

<p>Previously, I received a BS in applied math and statistics at Johns Hopkins focusing on statistical learning. At JHU, I worked with <a href="https://www.aacr.org/governance/victor-e-velculescu/">Dr. Victor Velculescu</a> and <a href="https://rscharpf.github.io/">Dr. Rob Scharpf</a> on methods for early cancer detection using liquid biopsies and understanding the biological origins of cell-free DNA. I also spent time with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/us/ibm_fellows/2019/ibm-fellow-gustavo-stolovitzky.html">Dr. Gustavo Stolovitzky</a> at IBM Research developing ensemble learning algorithms and modeling combination cancer therapy.</p>
